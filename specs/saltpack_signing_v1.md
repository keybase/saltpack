**This document specifies VERSION 1 of the saltpack signing format. This is a
legacy reference, for clients that issued version 1 messages in the past and
need to maintain read support. All new saltpack signing messages should use
VERSION 2.**

# Saltpack Binary Signing Format [version 1]

As with the encryption format, we want our signing format to have some
properties on top of a standard NaCl signature:
- Streaming. We want to be able to verify a message of any size, without
  fitting the whole thing in RAM, and without requiring a second pass to output
  attached plaintext. But we should only ever output verified data.
- Abuse resistance. Alice might use the same signing key for many applications
  besides saltpack. Mallory (an attacker) could [try to trick Alice into
  signing
  messages](https://blog.sandstorm.io/news/2015-05-01-is-that-ascii-or-protobuf.html)
  that are meaningful to other applications. Alice should avoid signing bytes
  that Mallory could have chosen.

## Design

We define two signing formats: one attached and one detached. The attached
format will have a header packet and payload packets similar to the encryption
format, with an empty packet at the end of the message, and an incrementing
counter to prevent reordering. The detached format will contain just a header
packet, with no payload.

Both formats will hash a random nonce along with the plaintext, and then sign
the resulting hash. This nonce serves two purposes. First, in the attached
format, it prevents an attacker from swapping in payload packets from other
messages. Second, in both formats, it helps us avoid signing bytes that an
attacker could predict in advance.

## Attached Implementation

When encoding strings, byte arrays, or arrays, pick the MessagePack
encoding that will use the fewest number of bytes.

An attached signature is a header packet, followed by any number of non-empty
payload packets, followed by an empty payload packet. An attached signing
header packet is a MessagePack array that looks like this:

```
[
    format name,
    version,
    mode,
    sender public key,
    nonce,
]
```

- **format name** is the string "saltpack".
- **version** is a list of the major and minor versions, currently `[1, 0]`, both encoded as
  [positive fixnums](https://github.com/msgpack/msgpack/blob/master/spec.md#int-format-family).
- **mode** is the number 1, for attached signing, encoded as a
[positive fixnum](https://github.com/msgpack/msgpack/blob/master/spec.md#int-format-family).
  (0 is encryption, and 2 is detached signing.)
- **sender public key** is the sender's long-term NaCl signing public key, 32 bytes.
- **nonce** is 32 random bytes.

As in the encryption spec, the header packet is serialized into a MessagePack
`array` object, hashed with SHA512 to produce the **header hash**, and then
serialized *again* into a MessagePack `bin` object.

Payload packets are MessagePack arrays that look like this:

```
[
    signature,
    payload chunk,
]
```

- **signature** is a detached NaCl signature, 64 bytes.
- **payload chunk** is a chunk of the plaintext bytes, max size 1 MB.

To make each signature, the sender first takes the SHA512 hash of the
concatenation of three values:
- the **header hash** from above
- the packet sequence number, as a 64-bit big-endian unsigned integer, where
  the first payload packet is zero
- the **payload chunk**

The sender then signs the concatenation of two values:
- `"saltpack attached signature\0"`
- the SHA512 hash above

As in the encryption spec, after encrypting the entire message, the sender adds
an extra payload packet with an empty payload to signify the end. If a message
doesn't end with an empty payload packet, the receiving client should report an
error that the message has been truncated.

## Detached Implementation

A detached signature header packet is equivalent to an attached signature
header packet with a different mode (2 instead of 1). As above it's
twice-encoded, with the **header hash** computed after the first encoding. A
detached header is followed by a single MessagePack `bin` object, containing
the 64-byte detached NaCl signature.

```
[
    format name,
    version,
    mode,
    sender public key,
    nonce,
]

signature
```

To make the signature, the sender first takes the SHA512 hash of the
concatenation of two values::
- the **header hash** from above
- the entire plaintext

The sender then signs the concatenation of two values:
- `"saltpack detached signature\0"`
- the SHA512 hash above

  # major and minor version
  [1, 0],
  # mode (1 = attached signing)
